This application allows the user to engage in a variety of INFOSEC-related activity, such as encryption and decryption, fake identity generation, sending HTTP requests, sending Nmap requests, and port-closing in a Windows 10 environment. Python and PowerShell is utilized in this, and the application functions on multiple different levels to function, requiring administrative access.
